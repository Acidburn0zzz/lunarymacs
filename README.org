#+TITLE: Lunarymacs

This is a stripped down version of doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working.

*Warning*: There is no seatbelt.

- code is easy to understand (because I don't really know much elisp)
- not opinionated: no default settings by default, everything is up to you, no more forking for customization
- absolute minimum core files
- no default package, except use-package

  
* Install
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
make
emacs
#+END_SRC
  
P.S. I don't know what is lunary, don't ask me.
