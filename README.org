#+TITLE: Lunarymacs

This is a stripped down frame work modeling after doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working.

*Warning*: There is no seatbelt.

- code is easy to understand (because I don't really know much elisp)
- not opinionated: no default settings by default, everything is up to you, no more forking for customization
- absolute minimum core files
- no default package, except use-package

* Thank you
Thanks to all the contributors of spacemacs and doom-emacs. I copyied a lot of code from them.

Thanks to everyone in emacs-china.org, you answered many questions of mine.

And of course a big thank-you to all the package contributors and emacs contributors. I can't enjoy such a great editor without your effort.

Emacs community is the best! :smile: :heart: (just rhetorical, not comparing :P)
* etc
  
I don't know what is lunary, don't ask me.

I know it says lunarymacs but homepage is moon emacs.
It's just the word "lunarymacs" doesn't look cool in that ascii art font.
