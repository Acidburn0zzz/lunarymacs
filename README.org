#+TITLE: Lunarymacs

This is a stripped down version of doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but works.

It might used as a starting point for anyone who wants to start his/her own config. 
Since that's what I'm doing and therefore there is no complicated code.

*In summary:*
- code is easy to understand
- not opinionated (no default settings by default, everything is up to you)
- absolutely minimum core files
- no default package, not even use-package!

  
P.S. I don't know what is lunary, don't ask me.
