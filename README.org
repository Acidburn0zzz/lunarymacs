This is a stripped down framework modeling after doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working.

*Warning:* There is no seatbelt.

- *code is easy* to understand (since I don't really know too much elisp)
- *not opinionated*: no default settings set in core. 
  everything is up to you, no more forking for customization
- *minimum* core files
- *no default package* required by core except use-package
  

*In summary:* 

This project is a good starting point of your own config!
You can:
1. Use my configuration(opinionated) and add your own config (submit PR if you think yours is good!)
2. *OR* Only use the core as a framework and manage your own configurations within it.
3. *OR* Just read the core and wiki as a reference and build your own config from scratch.

* Thank you
Thanks to all the contributors of spacemacs and doom-emacs. I copyied a lot of code from them.

Thanks to everyone in emacs-china.org, you answered many questions of mine.

And of course a big thank-you to all the package contributors and emacs contributors. I can't enjoy such a great editor without your effort.

Emacs community is the best! :smile: :heart: (just rhetorical, not comparing :P)
* etc
  
I don't know what is lunary, don't ask me.
