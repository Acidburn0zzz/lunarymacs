#+TITLE: Lunarymacs

This is a stripped down version of doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working.

*Warning*: There is no seatbelt.

- code is easy to understand (because I don't really know much elisp)
- not opinionated: no default settings by default, everything is up to you, no more forking for customization
- absolute minimum core files
- no default package, except use-package

#+CAPTION: May be it will look cooler withou nyan cat? But emacs without nyn cat is not emacs. It's emacs without nyan cat.

* Quick start

*backup you .emacs.d first!*

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
make
emacs
#+END_SRC
  
* Starup time

As much as I wish it to be, the starup time is not as fast as light.
Overall it's about 1-2 seconds. If you use space-line it would be around 2 seconds.
I set a timer for spaceline to load 0.3 sec after init.
So technically init finishes when "MOON" show up on screen.

If you have soem interesting ideas, send me an email!

I don't know what is lunary, don't ask me.

I know it says lunarymacs but homepage is moon emacs.
It's just the word "lunarymacs" doesn't go well with the art font
