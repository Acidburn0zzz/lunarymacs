#+TITLE: Conventions of this project

If you have a better convention, please tell me! :smile:

1. Eliminate the use of plurals
2. Instead of using plural to represent a list,
   use =xxx-(a/p)list=
3. I didn't use private variables and functions in /framework/.
   I just don't want to confuse myself. 
4. macros are represented by =macro|=.
5. represent commands with =moon/xxx=.
