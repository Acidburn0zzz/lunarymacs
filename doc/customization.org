#+TITLE: Customization

You can set some customizations using =customize= macro.

For example in =init.example.el=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(customize| 
 (setq moon-maximize-on-startup t)
 (setq moon-normal-state-cursor-color lunary-white)
 (setq moon-insert-state-cursor-color spacemacs-yellow)
)
#+END_SRC

I set cursor color for normal state to white, 
and yellow for insert state. There is also =doom-blue= that you can use.

These colors are all defined in =basci-ui= star

*When does customize evaluate?*

All the expressions declared by =customize|= are evaluated in =moon-post-init-hook=.
So it's after every =config.el= and =package.el= are loaded 
and all =use-package= are evaluated (in =moon-grand-use-package-call=).

But I don't see any use of it outside =init.el=, if you want to set seom variables,
set them in =config.el=. If you want some setting to evaluate after some package
has loaded, set them in =:config= flag in =use-package=.
