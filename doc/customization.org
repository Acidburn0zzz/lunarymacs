#+TITLE: Customization


Most of the settings should be in =config.el= in stars.

However, for some settings that you want to change by your mood,
such as theme and font, you can expose an api and set them in =init.el=.

- Before loading =package.el= and =config.el=
  Set them in init.el.
- After loading =package.e= and =config.el= and all package loaded.
  Use =customize= macro.

For example in =init.el=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(customize| 
 (setq moon-maximize-on-startup t)
 (setq moon-normal-state-cursor-color lunary-white)
 (setq moon-insert-state-cursor-color spacemacs-yellow)
)
#+END_SRC

It sets cursor color of normal state to white, 
that of insert state to yellow. 
There is also =doom-blue= and a bunch of colors that you can use.

These colors are all in =moon-color-book=. Check them out.
