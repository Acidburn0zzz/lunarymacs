#+TITLE: basic-ui

This start configures essential ui elements like 
font, cursor color, homescreen.

In contrast, ui star configures package
more on the "feature" side.

To be honest most of the stuff in here could be in =init.el= and =core-ui.el=.
I just don't want to put homepage settings in =core-ui.el=


- default fonts: (switch with =moon/load-font=)
  - SF Mono
  - Source Code Pro
- default cursor color:

| theme           | normal | insert |
|-----------------+--------+--------|
| spacemacs-dark  | yellow | pink   |
| spacemacs-light | purple | pink   |
